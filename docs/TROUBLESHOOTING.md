# Troubleshooting Guide

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Claude doesn't generate both artifacts
**Solution**: Ask: "Please create the HTML report as one artifact and the text summary as a separate artifact."

### Dates are inconsistent
**Solution**: Specify: "Please ensure ALL dates use the format Month DD, YYYY throughout both reports."

### Financial figures are rounded
**Solution**: Emphasize: "Use exact financial figures with all decimal places - never round dollar amounts."

### Missing PWS references
**Solution**: Request: "Add PWS section references to all major headers (e.g., Training Operations (PWS 3.1))."

### Bullet points not aligned
**Solution**: Ask for: "Fix bullet point alignment in training cards using padding-left: 0; list-style-position: inside;"
